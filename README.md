# eye-refraction
Simulating the image formed by refraction in a rotating eye using formulae

Said eye rotates around the origin. A fixed object projects an image, which is refracted by the lens of the eye onto a flat retina. 
Using Cramer's rule, the solution of two linear equations are found to map this movement. The points are plotted on a graph with Matplotlib.
